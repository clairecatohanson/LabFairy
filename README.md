# Lab Fairy

Welcome to Lab Fairy! This application provides a platform for research lab managers to administer shared lab equipment access, plan and schedule equipment maintenance, and track inventory supply requests. 

This UI of this app was built with React and styled with tailwindcss. The API was built with Django and Python.
